# Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge 2023

In this project We were tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which would be referred to as the target variable, would be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, etc. As with all data science projects, the provided features were rarely adequate predictors of the target variable. As such, we were required to perform feature engineering to ensure that we'd be able to accurately model Spain's three hourly shortfalls.
